## ‚ùóÔ∏è Disclaimers

- The Icarus Initiative is not affiliated with SOLHACK, Solana, or any other entity. This is a community-driven learning initiative to promote group study and creating a better learning experience for newcomers. This initiative came about due to the lack of a formal program and the myriad of resources that can often leave the uninitiated lost on their learning path. In the absence of a clear path, we blaze our own methodically and intelligently. We're patient because we know a few degrees off the flight compass can leave us hundreds of kilometers away from our destination.
- There is no promise of a job or that you will become a senior Rust/Solana/Blockchain developer as you progress through. Life gives you what ultimately put in. This initiative is not perfect but at least a starting point and hopefully become a better one with time and group effort.
- Benefits: domain visibility, connections, and projects, and future incentives. These squadmates and network connections might even be future co-founders or co-workers. Further innovations are being planned and developed, see Improvement Proposals.
- Requirements: Must already have completed Figment's Solana Pathway, have some programming experience like javascript or python, and be willing to pioneer.

## üß≠ Purpose

- Icarus Initiative (Icarus for short) is a community-driven, iterative curriculum and group learning experience for learning Rust and Solana blockchain development. It involves waves of small teams, called **squadrons** consisting of **pilots**. Each squadron can have from 2 pilots up to 5 pilots max. Squads iterate through **expeditions** (aka sprints, phases, etc) where they will build a project and evaluate at least 1 of the listed resource or a newer resource. The squad decides together what they will evaluate and more resources are encouraged if time permits. Projects and resources are not locked in and could potentially shift when the squad makes votes.
- **The project aspect**: reading is not the same as doing. Working to build a real project and more practical come time for the job hunt. Each person can build their own version of the project, in pairs, or eventually all together depending on the project scope. The squad element adds an accountability factor and the camaraderie will hopefully make the experience pleasurable. We learn best through having fun. There will always be someone ahead of you and someone behind you...well except the 1st squadron. üôÇ
- **The resource aspect**: resources will be evaluated and added to the appropriate expedition as squads cast their vote. Each squad can vote after they've evaluated any resource completely. Actions can be to add a resource to an expedition, move a resource from one expedition to another, or remove a resource from an expedition. During the presentations between former and latter squadrons, a voting process or collective agreement can be used to approve if the action should pass at least by a majority vote (50%). In case of a stalemate, further is discussion is started until ready for another revote. This complete process helps the next squadron to have increased confidence in the resource and if they want to use it on their own expedition. The curriculum gets better as more iterations have passed and the higher value resources will be funneled to the appropriate expedition to match skill against challenge. The sequence of the resource matters as the ones higher on the list is deemed more content valuable.
- **The social aspect:** having teammates to discuss and ask questions about the concurrent material helps cohesion. Social media interactions help foster friendship and build a reputation in the online community. LinkedIn and Github helps establish professional connections and domain visibility. Twitter is a place to have a faster, agile way to interact with the developer community. Video Content will also be produced from time to time to promote this initiative.
- We "fly neither too low nor too high". The important thing is to fly together at the right speed to complete a flight with the whole squadron. No one is left behind.
- What is the initiative name derived from? See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus).

- **Squad Dynamics**
  - The group environment serves to standardize the resources that all pilots use so there can be more active discussions and keep everyone on the same page for learning cohesion. Again, the group gets to choose the number of resources and which to evaluate so it's not too restrictive. The shortfalls are the opportunity cost of evaluating other resources and having to stick with the group pace and choice(s).
  - Squads will engage in coding, pair programming, weekly meetings, and social & professional connections to gain additional value. The level of engagement is not defined and left to the squad to organically form. The pilots should also be posting projects to GitHub as a portfolio builder and a reference for newer squads. A GitHub organization has been set up for general guidelines and group projects. Individual projects are encouraged to be version-controlled on personal GitHub accounts. See Methods section.
  - The 1st squad will complete their 1st expedition and subsequently elect 4 new members to start the 2nd squad. This pattern continues. For now, this linking pattern helps make the initiative funnel more quality resources and evolve at an appropriate pace. Growing too big too fast would detract from our purposes of building a quality learning path of content-rich resources. There are many ideas to scale when the need arises, see Improvement Proposals.
  - To advance to the next expedition, the current squadron must present their projects to any of the squadrons that have flown before them. With Icarus, it's more friendly in tone and aimed to give helpful criticism and praise as there are no stakes at risk. Ego and arrogance are left at the door. This is much like in deployment where the developers have to present their features to the stakeholders at the end of a sprint.

## ‚ùìFAQs

- How do I sign up for this initiative?
  - The initiative is being piloted right now to test drive the concept. Once the concept is more established and battle-tested, it can be appropriately released to bring in more squadrons!
- What's the cost of this initiative?
  - It's completely free and community-driven. You really get a lot more if you participate. Try stepping beyond the mindset of a student but a leader/teacher/instructor. Take lead on making educational content. Help answer technical questions to those who are struggling. Your skills will naturally elevate have to meet your goals.
- Are there any incentives to finish or join this group?
  - Currently, we are building partnerships and finding incentives but the only incentive right now is that you're helping build out the future learning path for learners. You will not be forgotten when incentives rolling out.
- Who do I contact about this initiative, comments, and suggestions?
  - Contact ksx on the SOLHACK or The Nydus discord channels. It's the fastest way.

## üî¨ Methods

- Each squadron:
  - Works to complete 1 project and evaluate at least 1 resource on each expedition. See each expedition for possible choices. If a group decides to add additional choices, a good starter list of resources can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Solana-and-Rust-Resources-Collection-a7c7b84256844ec0b3d416e910876db9) or in the SOLHACK discord various channels.
  - Expeditions can last as long as it takes for everyone to finish the project and evaluate the resource(s), whether it was done as a group/pair/solo. It's recommended to use 1 month to strike a balance for developers with full-time jobs and various responsibilities.
  - Before expeditions, make a markdown document and pull requests to the `squadrons.md` markdown file in the `main` repo. The file should have the pilot's preferred name, discord handle, country & time zone, Twitter handle, Github handle, LinkedIn profile, and amount of expeditions completed. The pull request will be reviewed and added accordingly.
  - Before expeditions, an additional folder called `1st_squadron.md` in the `main` repo will be created specifically for that squadron so they can link their projects from personal accounts, meeting notes, notable resources, and anything else they'd like to share with their squad and the public. All this is public!
  - Before expeditions, set up a discord chat and voice channel for that squadron. These will only be hidden from everyone else except discord admins and pilots of the squadron. It's private!
  - During expeditions, have weekly voice or video meetings for show and tell, asking questions, pair program, and set the goal for next week. This can be adjusted according to the group's needs.
  - During expeditions, squadron members are encouraged to tweet weekly progress and tag their teammates in the tweets. Hashtags are currently being worked out but for now, tag your teammates and #icarusiniative.
  - After expeditions, a squad will present to another squad that has previously completed the same expedition in the past. It could be adjacent or even higher up. The first squad presents among each other. This is also a good time to brief the next squad on the next expedition.
  - After expeditions, each squad decides where the evaluated resource(s) get placed in the most appropriate expedition(s) (whether course, book, youtube playlist, etc).
  - After expeditions, the squadron chooses the 2-5 pilots for the next squadron if we are still on a small-scale operation. Larger scale operations should see Improvement Proposals for scaling ideas.
  - After expeditions, write everyone in your group a LinkedIn recommendation about working on Icarus together. Upvote skills like rust, web 3.0, javascript, and whatever skills they've used in their projects. Connect with your squadmates if you haven't already done so. üôÇ
  - After expeditions, squads then advance to the next expedition and all pilots (old and new) are recorded on the Squadrons List. 1 person from each squadron can make a pull request to update the `[squadrons.md](http://squadrons.md)` list.

## üîÆ Improvement Proposals

### General

- Create a PoC video on youtube to gain visibility.
- Create flight updates from expeditions to gain visibility.
- Organize the virtual events to gain visibility.
- Translate this document to create a website.
  - Have logins, interactive features, etc on the website.
  - Gamify the process to display account achievements.
- Come up with a better name? SOL Squadron? Rust Raiders?

### Curriculum

- Consult actual companies and see what they are looking for.
  Use job postings as guidance for now.
- Create a feedback form to capture experiences after expeditions.
- Create a process to update the curriculum.
- Squads to possibly build projects for new squads to use, like the NFT platform to mint wings for completing expeditions.

### Organization

- Implement Discourse, high priority

### Scaling

- Idea 1 - Remove the selection process, have multiple squads instead of a single squad for a squadron, add divisions into the names like 22nd Squad Division A, and all 22nd squads can connect with 21st for mentorship and help.
- Idea 2 - Each member of a squad branches out to lead a new squad. This fan-like pattern is another option but most likely more intricate to implement.

### Monetization

- Community tokens with support from Solstar Finance.
- SOL Rewards for completing expeditions. Funded by Solana.
- Hats, T-shirts, and sunglasses rewards for reaching the 5th flight plan. Funded by Solana.
- Wings NFTs for members who have completed expeditions. Provided by an Expedition Project.
