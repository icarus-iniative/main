## ‚ùóÔ∏è Disclaimers

- The Icarus Initiative is not affiliated with Solana, SOLHACK, or any other entity. This is a community-driven learning initiative to promote group study and creating a better learning experience for newcomers.
- There is no promise of a job or that you will become a senior Rust/Solana/Blockchain developer as you progress through. Life gives you what ultimately put in.
- This initiative is not perfect but at least a starting point and hopefully become a better one with time and group effort.

## ‚ùì Introduction

> What is the Icarus Iniative?

- A zero-cost, crowdsource community of Rust/Solana learners that iteratively improve the curriculum by building projects, evaluating resources, and voting on curriculum development.
- This initiative came about due to the myriad of resources that can often leave the uninitiated lost on their learning path.
- In the absence of a clear path, we blaze our own trail methodically and intelligently.

> What are the requirements to join the Icarus Iniative?

- The developer must already have completed Figment's Solana Protocol (see `resources.md`), have some programming experience like javascript or python, and be willing to pioneer.
- The minimum skills are listed more in depth in the [1st_expedition_project_guidelines markdown](https://github.com/icarus-initiative/icarus_initiative).

> What are the benefits of joining this initiative?

- A passionate community to learn with.
- It filters out the folks who are just mere dabblers.
- Having an impactful voice to building the curriculum for future learners.
- Earning domain visibility in the industry.
- Making professional and personal connections.
- Creating tangible projects to showcase.
- Discourse to use as a forum and knowledge hub.
- Discord for community interaction.
- Github Organization for aggregating useful deliverables.
- Twitter to socially interact with the online community.
- Many other incentives, partnerships, and growth are planned.

> How do I sign up for this initiative?

- The initiative is being piloted right now to test drive the concept. Once the concept is more established and battle-tested, it can be appropriately released to bring in more squadrons!

> What's the cost of this initiative?

- It's completely free and community-driven. You really get a lot more if you participate. When you listen, you learn. When you talk, I learn. When either teaches, we both learn. This is a community to empower members to take the lead to help foster a learning community. Each pilot contributes in their own way whether it's by voting, creating content, or sharing deliverables.

> What role can I play in this initiative?

- *Roles Available*
  - *Member* - A member of the community who wishes to observe or is looking to join/create a squad.
  - *Pilot* -  Active learners who embark on learning expeditions by building recommended projects and evaluating different resources.
  - Pilots are required to have completed Figment's Solana Pathway before starting the 1st expedition.
  - *Captain* -  Takes more of a leadership role in a squadron by merging PRs, organizing the groups, capturing squad members thoughts & concerns, communicating with admins to build out the curriculum further. Captains are obviously pilots also because they are leading their squad on the expedition.
  - *Admin* - Set up systems and infrastructure for squads and the organization, optimize systems to demystify knowledge and make more accessible, and handle any public relations.

> How to squadrons briefly work?

- A squad consisting of 4-6 members embark on expeditions to level up together. A squadron aims to build a recommended project and evaluating at least one course, video series, or code sets on an expedition.
- There's many variables left up to the squad to decide something more benefitting including other projects, expedition length, additional resources, and any other innovative ideas.
- At least one of the members will be the captain, who will delegate and serve as a representive for the squadron. It's recommended that there's 2 captains to make the squad flow with major hitches. They would help with merging PRs, gathering the group, and communicating with organization admins.
- While there's the personal learning aspect, the social aspect will promote cohesion and cameraderie. We use various platforms that will be listed in the benefits section.

> Are there any incentives to finish or join this group?

- The current incentives right now are becoming a recognized leader in the space and builder of the learning path for learners. There will be partnerships and incentives in the future. You will not be forgotten when incentives rolling out.

> What are some of the methods for the organization?

- Crowdsourcing can be a powerful force to help build the community that this initiative aims to harness and transmute into a platform for new learners.
- The aim is not to make a set curriculum but rather one that can be flexible and adaptive to the community needs.
- A lot of the power is distributed to each squadron to as how they want to guide their own learning. The squadron comes together and validates ideas to contribute back to the initiative. Think of the Socratic method meet blockchain concepts.
- Members, pilots, and captains are encouraged to take charge of their own learning, disseminate knowledge and experiences for future learners, and blazing a trail where there are none. These transmutations can take various forms such as creating deliverables for consumption, helping to answer technical questions, or leading events.

## üß≠ Purpose

- Icarus Initiative (Icarus for short) is a community-driven, iterative curriculum and group learning experience for learning Rust and Solana blockchain development. It involves waves of small teams, called **squadrons** consisting of **pilots**. Each squadron can have from 4 pilots up to 6 pilots max. Squads iterate through **expeditions** (aka sprints, phases, etc) where they will build a project and evaluate at least 1 of the listed resource or a newer resource. The squad decides together what they will evaluate and more resources are encouraged if time permits. Projects and resources are not locked in and could potentially shift if the squad makes votes.
- **The project aspect**: reading is not the same as doing. Working to build a real project and more practical come time for the job hunt. Each person can build their own version of the project, in pairs, or eventually all together depending on the project scope. The squad element adds an accountability factor and the camaraderie will hopefully make the experience pleasurable. We learn best through having fun. There will always be someone ahead of you and someone behind you...well except the 1st squadron. üôÇ
- **The resource aspect**: There can be a max of 10 resources per expedition. This positional scarcity will make it so only the highest quality of resources remain in the list. Each squadron gets an eligible vote on a resource only if they've completely evaluated it. After each expedition, the same squad gets an eligible vote on the same resource to either move or delete the same resource. In addition, every new resource evaluated gives the squadron a new eligible vote on that resource. So by the end of the 2nd expedition, the squad can vote on the resource they've consumed on the 1st expedition and a vote on the newer resource they've consumed in the 2nd expedition, totaling 2 votes total.
- In short, the more resources the squad consumes, the more votes they are able to cast.
- Again, squads can only cast votes after they've completed an expedition.
- The limit is that there will ever only be limited amount of expeditions. The exact amount is still being planned because there can be elective expeditions in the future.
- The resource list scarcity and the ability to cast votes makes each vote hold more weight.
- This complete process helps the next squadron to have increased confidence in the resource and if they want to use it on their own expedition.
- The curriculum gets better as more iterations have passed and the higher value resources will be funneled to the appropriate expedition to match skill against challenge and also ranked within the lists. The sequence of the resource matters as the ones higher on the list is deemed more content valuable.
- **The social aspect:** having teammates to discuss and ask questions about the concurrent material helps cohesion. Social media interactions help foster friendship and build a reputation in the online community. LinkedIn and Github helps establish professional connections and domain visibility. Twitter is a place to have a faster, agile way to interact with the developer community. Video Content will also be produced from time to time to promote this initiative.
- We "fly neither too low nor too high". The important thing is to fly together at the right speed to complete a flight with the whole squadron. No one is left behind.
- What is the initiative name derived from? See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus).

- **Squad Dynamics**
  - The group environment serves to standardize the resources that all pilots use so there can be more active discussions and keep everyone on the same page for learning cohesion. Again, the group gets to choose the number of resources and which to evaluate so it's not too restrictive. The shortfalls are the opportunity cost of evaluating other resources and having to stick with the group pace and choice(s).
  - Squads recommended to engage in coding, pair programming, weekly meetings, and social & professional connections to gain additional value. The level of engagement is not defined and left to the squad to organically form. The pilots should also be posting projects to GitHub as a portfolio builder and a reference for newer squads. A GitHub organization has been set up for general guidelines and group projects. Admins can create a project repo upon a captain's request. Individual projects are encouraged to be version-controlled on personal GitHub accounts. See Methods section.
  - The 1st squadron pilots were self elected. Afterwards, a new user wishing to start a squad should contact an admin to create a team so that they can recruit for their squad. The captains needs to recruit 3-5 more people to join their squadrons in order to start. The selection process is left to that squad. The newly created squad's teampage on github will allow a place for discussion and recruitment. This process is left again to the squad to decide on how to recruit for factors like time zone and skill matches.
  - To advance to the next expedition, the current squadron must present their projects to any of the squadrons that have flown before them. With Icarus, it's more friendly in tone and aimed to give helpful criticism and praise as there are no stakes at risk. Ego and arrogance are left at the door. This is much like in deployment where the developers have to present their features to the stakeholders at the end of a sprint.

## üî¨ Methods

- Each squadron:
  - Works to complete 1 project and evaluate at least 1 resource on each expedition. See each expedition for possible choices. If a group decides to add additional choices, a good starter list of resources can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Solana-and-Rust-Resources-Collection-a7c7b84256844ec0b3d416e910876db9) or in the SOLHACK discord various channels.
  - Expeditions can last as long as it takes for everyone to finish the project and evaluate the resource(s), whether it was done as a group/pair/solo. It's recommended to use 1 month to strike a balance for developers with full-time jobs and various responsibilities.
  - Before expeditions, a team formed by the captain will make a pull request to the `squadrons.md` markdown file in the `main` repo. The file should have the pilot's preferred name, discord handle, country & time zone, Twitter handle, Github handle, LinkedIn profile, and amount of expeditions completed. The pull request will be reviewed and added accordingly.
  - Before expeditions, an additional folder called `1st_squadron.md` in the `main` repo will be created specifically for that squadron so they can link their projects from personal accounts, meeting notes, notable resources, and anything else they'd like to share with their squad and the public. All this is public!
  - Before expeditions, set up a discord chat channel for that squadron. These will only be hidden from members. Other squads, captains, and admins can see the channel.
  - During expeditions, have weekly voice or video meetings for show and tell, asking questions, pair program, and set the goal for next week. This can be adjusted according to the group's needs.
  - During expeditions, squadron members are encouraged to tweet weekly progress and tag their teammates in the tweets. Hashtags are currently being worked out but for now, tag your teammates and #icarusiniative.
  - After expeditions, a squad will present to another squad that has previously completed the same expedition in the past. It could be adjacent or even higher up. The first squad presents among each other. This is also a good time to brief the next squad on the next expedition.
  - After expeditions, each squad cast their votes on where the evaluated resource(s) get placed in the most appropriate expedition(s).
  - After expeditions, pilots are encouraged to write a LinkedIn recommendation for squadmates about working on Icarus together. Upvote skills like rust, web 3.0, javascript, and whatever skills they've used in their projects. Connect with your squadmates if you haven't already done so. üôÇ
  - After expeditions, squads will be recognized by the upper squad they've presented to and notify an admin to update the [squadrons.md](https://github.com/icarus-initiative/icarus_initiative/blob/main/squadrons.md) file by making a pull request notifying that the other squad succeed in their expedition. It is the responsibility of squads to make the PR or notify admins for this.

## üîÆ Improvement Proposals

### General

- Create a PoC video on youtube.
- Create flight updates from expeditions.
- Organize the weekly virtual meetings.
- SOL Squadron? Rust Raiders?

### Curriculum

- Resource voting system.
- Consult actual companies and see what they are looking for.
- Use job postings as guidance for now.
- Create a feedback form to capture experiences after expeditions.
- Create a process to update the curriculum.
- Squads to possibly build projects for new squads to use, like the NFT platform to mint wings for completing expeditions.

### Organization

- Create a website.
  - Have logins, interactive features, etc on the website.
  - Gamify the process to display account achievements.
- Create a forum system.
  - [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)
  - [ElkArte](https://www.elkarte.net/)
  - [SimpleMachine](https://www.simplemachines.org/).

### Scaling

- Selection System.
- Idea 1 - Remove the selection process, have multiple squads instead of a single squad for a squadron, add divisions into the names like 22nd Squad Division A, and all 22nd squads can connect with 21st for mentorship and help.
- Idea 2 - Each member of a squad branches out to lead a new squad. This fan-like pattern is another option but most likely more intricate to implement.

### Monetization

- Community tokens rewards.
- Wings NFTs for members who have completed expeditions. Provided by an expedition Project.
- Hats, T-shirts, and sunglasses rewards for reaching the 4th flight plan.
- SOL Rewards for completing expeditions.
