- Document Version 2021_10

- The expeditions document shows a path a squad can take.
- It also shows the resources that were voted in to the slots.

- The [Figment Solana protocol](https://learn.figment.io/protocols/solana) is recommended to be completed prior to engaging in expeditions.
- These are subject to change as pilots cast votes.
- More resources to be added to expeditions as squadrons progress.

## 1st Expedition

### Goal

- On the technology side, we build slowly with tech that's familiar (like javascript or react) and sprinkle in new technology (web3.js API, datahub, solana concepts). This gives time for learning some Rust which is useful later on. For newer pilots, it allows for squad syncing up on concepts of version control, file folder structuring, and any other common development processes in the industry.
- We aim to work with Solana SDKs like [solana-web3js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) and DataHub(https://datahub.figment.io/). We will also use this project for our portfolio so make it nice! Use tools you haven't tried before as the only limit is you.
- The 1st expedition is about building relationships and trust within with your squad. This helps you connect with your teammates and adapt learning & communication styles. Hopefully, you'll build good relationships to work together on the next expeditions and compete in hack-a-thon's.
- To see past projects, visit the a squad's repository, like [1st_squadron_core](https://github.com/icarus-initiative/1st_squadron_core), on the github organization.

## 2nd Expedition

### Goal

- The goal now is to work together on a group project and learn to work with smart contracts.
- Technology-wise, the team progresses closer to the blockchain technologies and try out different frameworks and libraries.
- The predominant framework on Solana is Anchor.
- We take our learnings from the 1st expedition to understanding some Rust under the hood.
- Then we will work with Anchor to build a basic smart contract.
