# Icarus Initiative - Expeditions

- Document version 1.0 (2021-8-8)
- The expeditions document is the ever-shifting curriculum that squadrons use.

- The [Solana pathway on figment.io](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/solana) must have been completed prior to engaging in expeditions.
- These are subject to change as squads cast votes.
- More resources to be added to expeditions as squadrons progress...

## 1st Expedition

- **The Goal**
  - The 1st expedition is about building relationships with your squad. This helps you connect with your teammates and adapt learning & communication styles. Hopefully, you'll build good relationships to work together on the next expeditions and compete in hack-a-thon's.
  - On the technology side, we build slowly on purpose with what's already familiar and give ample time for reading and learning the foundations of the blockchain. It also gives others to help the other pilots get up to speed about version control, file folder structuring, and any other common development processes in the industry. We aim to work with Solana SDKs like solana-web3js. We will also use this project for our portfolio so make it nice! Use tools you haven't tried before as the only limit is you.
  - To see past projects, visit a squadrons file, like `1st_squadron.md` in `main` to see their projects.
- **The Project**
  - Build a wallet that is connected to the datahub testnet blockchain backend with a front-end language of your choice.
  - It should be a wallet that has a send and receive on the menu bar.
  - It should be able to pull the current balance from the testnet blockchain.
  - It should be able to send lamports from your wallet to a specified wallet and a specified amount that the user inputs.
  - It should generate the Solana Explorer URL that users can click to see their transactions.
  - It should be able to have a way to display the public address to receive lamports.
  - Stretch goal: explore the solana/web3.js documentation to see what else you can implement ([https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)).
  - Stretch goal: implement a QR code, tweet, email, or link for your public address so others can send lamports to your wallet.
  - Stretch goal: implement a seed file with a directory of a friend's address that loads on app start. Implement the directory feature and add it to the menu bar.
  - Stretch goal: implement a fun theme to your wallet from Spriters Resources ([https://www.spriters-resource.com/](https://www.spriters-resource.com/)). Make the sprites animated!
