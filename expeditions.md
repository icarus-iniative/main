# Icarus Initiative - Expeditions

- Document version 1.1 (2021-8-28)
- The expeditions document is the ever-shifting curriculum that squadrons use.

- The [Solana protocol](https://learn.figment.io/protocols/solana) must have been completed prior to engaging in expeditions.
- These are subject to change as squads cast votes.
- More resources to be added to expeditions as squadrons progress...

## 1st Expedition

### Goal

- The 1st expedition is about building relationships and trust within with your squad. This helps you connect with your teammates and adapt learning & communication styles. Hopefully, you'll build good relationships to work together on the next expeditions and compete in hack-a-thon's.
- On the technology side, we build slowly on purpose with what's already familiar and give ample time for reading and learning the foundations of the blockchain. It also gives others to help the other pilots get up to speed about version control, file folder structuring, and any other common development processes in the industry. We aim to work with Solana SDKs like [solana-web3js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js). We will also use this project for our portfolio so make it nice! Use tools you haven't tried before as the only limit is you.
- To see past projects, visit the a squad's repository, like [1st_squadron_core](https://github.com/icarus-initiative/1st_squadron_core) on the github organization.

## 2nd Expedition

### Goal

- The goal now is to work together to build an identity solution and working between the squad members to test and verify. Now with everyone has built trust with working together and understanding each other's strengths, it's time to tackle bigger and bigger projects.
- Technology-wise, the team progresses closer to the blockchain technologies and try out different frameworks and libraries. This will take exploration on the team's behalf to try out even newer technologies. It's time to step beyond the comfort zone.

## 3rd Expedition

### Goal

- NFT's a big thing in the blockchain. Inevitably, you will probably have to build out some version of NFTs anyways, let's make it a project.

### Project

- Build an NFT Minting Platform and mint NFT variations (master, open, and limited editions)

## 4th Expedition

### Goal

- Great job on making this this far. Hopefully the squad has learned enough to make a big scale project and working to collaborate together. Now, we'll work on an enterprise level project from start to finish. This would be the equivalent of a capstone project of a bootcamp. Make the MVP, make it real, and potentially get hired as a developer. We have at least 4 projects after this expedition which is probably more than enough to get a job in blockchain. It's so exciting to reach this point, the future is teeming with possibilities.

### Project

- Build an RPG Game that uses NFTs to represent rare items in the games.
